# compilerbau-WS17-18

*We're building a compiler. It'll compile things.*

More specifically, this compiler will be able to translate a narrow subset of Java to JVM bytecode, taking a scenic tour through all the necessary steps in the form of multiple passes: lexing, parsing, typechecking, codegen'ing and serializing. TODO more prose?
